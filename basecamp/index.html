    <p>Hey, I‚Äôm <strong>Matthew Lettini</strong>, a product designer working remotely from Brooklyn, NYC. This is my hastily put together application for the <strong>Senior Designer role at Basecamp</strong>. Welcome! üëã</p>
    <p>I‚Äôm very excited for this rare opportunity. Below you‚Äôll find a page I made just for this application. If you haven‚Äôt read it yet, <a href="#basecamp-cover-letter" onclick="toggle_visibility('basecamp-cover-letter');">my cover letter</a> is where you  can learn more about me and why I‚Äôm applying for this job.</p><p> As I explain there, I‚Äôve been employed by <a href="https://getharvest.com" target="_blank">Harvest</a> for more than a <em>decade</em>, and I wasn‚Äôt ready to apply anywhere when I learned you were hiring. Unfortunately, due to work obligations, I wasn‚Äôt able to deliver you a more complete portfolio earlier, but I‚Äôll be adding detailed case studies for a few projects below over time.</p>
    <p>I‚Äôm happy to chat more about anything‚Äîmy decade at Harvest, what I can bring to Basecamp, or my favorite D&amp;D class. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:mlettini@hey.com">mlettini@hey.com</a> or <tel>516-978-0881</tel>.</p>

  <section id="basecamp-cover-letter" style="display:none">
    <p>üëã To Jason, David, and the team at Basecamp,</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been a Basecamp fan and user for many years. I nodded my head reading <em>It Doesn‚Äôt Have to Be Crazy at Work</em>, followed the 37Signals blog on and off, have been inspired by your public company policies, and was an early sign up for HEY. So I was elated to see ‚Äúhiring a Senior Designer‚Äù land in my imbox.</p>
<p>But being a fan is not a qualification. Here is why I‚Äôd be a great candidate for the job‚Äî</p>
<p><strong>This October I hit 10 years as a designer at <a href="https://getharvest.com">Harvest</a>.</strong> I was the first full-time design hire back in 2010, and I‚Äôm now the most senior member of the product team. I‚Äôve grown and experienced a lot in the past decade.</p>
<p>At Harvest, I‚Äôve owned or been responsible for many things in various and changing capacities over the years, including both web products (Harvest and Forecast), our desktop and mobile apps, the marketing site, support documentation, data and success metrics, mentoring coworkers, and leading internal workshops. Under the tutelage of co-founders Shawn Liu and Danny Wen and various colleagues over the years, the hats I wear have grown from purely designer to also product strategist, project manager, front-end developer, researcher, writer, data analyst, and more.</p>
<p>I excel as a generalist because I love solving design problems and challenges. My small way of impacting the world is to make software simpler and more clear for people to use. <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> and the principles of affordance are my North Star. And at the core: human-centered design and strong communication.</p>
<p>I have worked on both top-level product strategy and low-level code implementation. I can take ideas from initial spark to finished product. And for the past couple of years now, I‚Äôve been doing this in cycles and the <em>Shape Up</em> methodology at Harvest. I‚Äôve both shaped and de-risked ideas into pitches, as well as scope-hammered work and successfully led teams to ship within 6 weeks.</p>
<p>After 10 years, I‚Äôm looking for new challenges, and the future of Basecamp and HEY offers a rare opportunity. These are tools that fundamentally help individuals and teams get things done, while retaining control and calm in their lives. They‚Äôre used for everything from personal needs, to planning small events, to building global businesses. And they‚Äôre built by an outspoken company that has inspired me for years.</p>
<p><strong>Helping design tools that help people change the world gets me excited to produce again.</strong> üëè</p>
<p>I believe my skills and experience have set me up well for this opportunity. There‚Äôd be no learning curve working in cycles or being a manager of one, I understand the intricacies of designing SaaS products made for teams, and I‚Äôm a user of both BC3 and HEY. Heck, I‚Äôve even sent in a few feature requests over the years.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôm also excited for the chance to work alongside and learn from the best in the industry. Your team and work has been influential in shaping what it looks like to build software and treat users like humans. I‚Äôm looking for my next long-term stay, and Basecamp is where I‚Äôd like to grow over my next decade.</p>
<p>Since I‚Äôm not the type of employee to hop from job-to-job, I wasn‚Äôt ready to apply anywhere when I learned you were hiring. So I hope you‚Äôll excuse <a href="https://matthewlettini.me/basecamp">my hastily put together resume-folio</a>, just for this application. It‚Äôs my attempt at highlighting the work I‚Äôm most proud of and how my role has changed over the years. While I didn‚Äôt have time to write detailed case studies for every project, I plan to add to it over the next week, and I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.</p>
<p>Finally, I‚Äôll also mention that I bring my full, weird self to everything I do. Like everyone else, COVID-19 has up-ended most of my non-work life. So while I‚Äôd love to speak more about my love for basketball, traveling, karaoke, and D&amp;D, sadly those have all been on hold. But in their place is more camping in the catskills, moving during a pandemic, and trying to spend more time with my niece and nephew before they grow up too fast.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Matthew Lettini</p>

        <h2>Harvest <span>(Senior Product Designer)</span></h2>
        <p>In 2018, Harvest made some big internal changes: implementing cycles, shuffling teams around, hiring new directors, adding OKRs, and other process shifts. My role has moved to senior, and alongside continuing to shape pitches and lead cycles, I also help mentor others on the product team.</p>
        <p>As mentioned, I plan to write more elaborate case studies for some of these, but here‚Äôs a list of things I worked on recently:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Improved our multi-step welcome flow to better onboard new trials and remove friction in new account setup.
            <a href="/basecamp/welcome-flow" class="basecamp-work-link">
              üëâ Read the full welcome flow case study
              <img src="/images/basecamp/wf-image-9.png" alt="">
            </a></li>
          <li>Audited and proposed a significant upgrade to Harvest‚Äôs inconsistent information architecture (IA).</li>
          <li>Added all new email and desktop notification reminders, to help customers prompt themselves to track time.</li>
          <li>Improved the cancellation flow to remove friction, and add a new exit survey to help us understand customer churn.</li>
          <li>Added an easier way for customers paying yearly to notice and remove unused paid seats.</li>
          <li>Small improvements to make recurring invoicing less manual.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><small><em>Note: You can also peruse <a href="https://blog.getharvest.com/author/matt-lettini/" target="_blank">my public Harvest blog posts</a> to see projects I‚Äôve worked on, though my more recent work hasn‚Äôt ended up on the blog.</em></small></p>

        <h2>Harvest Forecast <span>(Lead Product Designer)</span></h2>
        <p>In 2013, Harvest‚Äôs co-founders had an idea to build a sister service. While Harvest helps customers understand what their team is or was working on (the present and past), Forecast helps them visually plan and understand who will work on what and when (the future).</p>
        <p>I was the lead and sole designer for five years, and today over 68,000 people across 3400 teams are being scheduled in Forecast. Here are some highlight projects from this time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The 1.0 journey: Brought Forecast from back-of-napkin idea, to prototype, to closed beta, to public launch.</li>
          <li>Introduced the concept of scheduling placeholders when it‚Äôs unclear who should be assigned.</li>
          <li>Added support for scheduling on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) and other non-work days.</li>
          <li>Added new flexible filtering options to the schedule, so customers can more easily find what they need.</li>
          <li>Conceived and built all billing flows, such as upgrading to a paid plan, changing plans, discounts, and cancellation.</li>
          <li>Added Forecast assignments to Harvest project reports, so customers can track their estimates against their actuals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><small><em>Note: You can also peruse old <a href="https://blog.getharvest.com/tag/forecast/" target="_blank">public Forecast blog posts</a>. Even if I didn‚Äôt write the post, chances are I worked on that update.</em></small></p>

        <h2>Harvest <span>(Product Designer)</span></h2>
        <p>I started in October 2010. I think I got lucky because the co-founder and I connected over The Dismemberment Plan. My first assignments were major projects, and I quickly learned a lot collaborating with Shawn Liu. This was a critical time for my career, when I stopped designing for pure visual appeal and started considering the user experience and the customers using our service. Here are some highlight projects from this time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed the new Timesheet, the core component of Harvest.</li>
          <li>Designed an all new Reporting suite. They were faster and more reliable at offering insights into your business.</li>
          <li>The first version of our Mac desktop companion app. Helps customers track time in their day without needing a browser.</li>
          <li>The first in-house version of our iPhone mobile companion app. Helps customers track time and expenses on the go.</li>
          <li>Multiple iterations of our marketing homepage (getharvest.com).</li>
          <li>Helping design the <a href="https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/" target="_blank">Chosen</a> javascript library to make long select boxes more user-friendly.</li>

        <h2>Pre-Harvest <span>(Designer)</span></h2>
        <p>While it feels like a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I did have a few jobs before Harvest. My early career highlights include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Redesigned indie music startup AmieStreet, with a heavy emphasis on a unique payment model and new artists.</li>
          <li>Created multiple versions of a new Songza, which changed from internet radio, to community-based radio, to curated playlists.</li>
          <li>My first paid designer role was helping startup PeoplesMD create a community-powered database for treating and living with illnesses, diseases, and other ailments.</li>
          <li>Built and ran personal music blog The Heavy Edition for a few years. Garnered a few hundred followers at the time.</li>
          <li>Various freelance and contract gigs included building websites, brand identities, and even converting CSS to work with IE6.</li>
