    <p>Hey, I‚Äôm <strong>Matthew Lettini</strong>, a product designer working remotely from Brooklyn, NYC. This is my hastily put together application for the <strong>Senior Designer role at Basecamp</strong>. Welcome! üëã</p>
    <p>I‚Äôm very excited for this rare opportunity. You can <a href="#basecamp-cover-letter" onclick="toggle_visibility('basecamp-cover-letter');">open and read my cover letter</a> for a bit more background on me and why I‚Äôm applying for the job, or just jump right in to my work below. I‚Äôm happy to chat more about anything‚Äîmy decade at Harvest, what I can bring to Basecamp, or my favorite D&amp;D class. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:mlettini@hey.com">mlettini@hey.com</a> or <tel>516-978-0881</tel>. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.</p>
    <div id="basecamp-cover-letter" style="display:none">
      <p>To Jason, David, and the team at Basecamp,</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been a Basecamp fan and user for many years. I nodded my head reading <em>It Doesn‚Äôt Have To Be Crazy At Work</em>, followed the 37Signals blog on and off, been inspired by your public company policies, and was an early sign up for HEY. So I was elated to see ‚Äúhiring a Senior Designer‚Äù land in my imbox.</p>
<p>But being a fan is not a qualification. Here is why I‚Äôd be a great candidate for the job‚Äî</p>
<p><strong>This October I hit 10 years as a designer at <a href="https://getharvest.com">Harvest</a>.</strong> I was the first full-time design hire back in 2010. Now the most senior member of the product team, I‚Äôve grown and experienced a lot in the past decade.</p>
<p>At Harvest, I‚Äôve owned or been responsible for many things in various and changing capacities over the years, including both web products (Harvest and Forecast), our desktop and mobile apps, the marketing site, support documentation, data and success metrics, mentoring coworkers, and leading internal workshops. Under the tutelage of co-founders Shawn Liu and Danny Wen and various colleagues over the years, the hats I wear have grown from purely designer to also product strategist, project manager, front-end developer, researcher, writer, data analyst, and more.</p>
<p>I excel as a generalist because I love solving design problems and challenges. My small way of impacting the world is to make software simpler and more clear for people. <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> and the principles of affordance are my North Star. And at its core: human-centered design and strong communication.</p>
<p>I have worked on both top-level product strategy and low-level code implementation. I can take ideas from initial spark to finished product. And for the past couple of years now, I‚Äôve been doing this in cycles and the <em>Shape Up</em> methodology at Harvest. I‚Äôve both shaped and de-risked ideas into pitches, as well as scope-hammered work and successfully led a team to ship within 6 weeks.</p>
<p>After 10 years, I‚Äôm looking for new challenges, and the future of Basecamp and HEY offers a rare opportunity. These are fundamental tools that help individuals and teams get things done, while retaining control and calm in their lives. They‚Äôre used for everything from personal needs, to planning small events, to building global businesses. And their built by an outspoken company that has inspired me for years.</p>
<p><strong>Helping design tools that help people change the world gets me excited to produce again.</strong></p>
<p>I believe my skills and experience have set me up well for this opportunity. There‚Äôd be no learning curve working in cycles or being a manager of one, I understand the intricacies of designing SaaS products made for teams, and I‚Äôm already a user of both BC3 and HEY. Heck, I‚Äôve even sent in a few feature requests over the years.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôm also excited for the chance to learn from the best in the industry. The team behind Basecamp has been influential in shaping what it looks like to build software and treat users like humans. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd like to grow over my next decade.</p>
<p>Since I‚Äôm not the type of employee to hop from job-to-job, I hope you‚Äôll excuse this hastily put together resume-folio. I had only been on the fence before I saw your open position, so I didn‚Äôt have something more cohesive ready-to-go.</p>
<p>Below is my attempt to quickly timeline and highlight some of the work I‚Äôm most proud of. While I didn‚Äôt have time to write detailed case studies for every project, I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.</p>
<p>Finally, I‚Äôll mention that I bring my full, weird self to everything I do. Like everyone else, COVID-19 has up-ended most of my non-work life. So while I‚Äôd love to speak more about my love for basketball, traveling, karaoke, and D&amp;D, sadly those have all been on hold. But in their place is more camping in the catskills, moving during a pandemic, training my guitar fingers again, and trying to spend more time with my niece and nephew before they grow up too fast.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Matthew Lettini</p>

        <h2>Harvest <span>Senior Product Designer</span></h2>
        <p>In 2018, Harvest shuffled things around. The team underwent some large changes in the last few years: implementing cycles, hiring new directors, adding OKRs, and other process shifts. My role moved to senior, and alongside continuing to shape pitches and lead cycles, I also help mentor others on the product team.</p>
        <p>Projects from this time are small but numerous. Read these case studies for a detailed look at some of my work:</p>
        <ul class="basecamp-case-study-links">
          <li><a href="#">Improved our <strong>multi-step welcome flow</strong> to better onboard new trials, and remove friction in getting familiar with a new account.</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Audited and proposed a significant upgrade to Harvest‚Äôs inconsistent <strong>information architecture (IA)</strong>.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other major projects from this time include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added all new email and desktop notification reminders, to help customers prompt themselves to track time.</li>
          <li>Improved cancellation flow with a new exit survey, to help us understand why customers churn, and remove friction from the cancellation experience.</li>
          <li>Added an easier way for yearly accounts to notice and remove unused paid seats, to help prevent the headache of issuing refunds.</li>
          <li>Small improvements to make recurring invoicing less manual.</li>
          <li><em>Note: You can also peruse old <a href="https://blog.getharvest.com/author/matt-lettini/" target="_blank">public Harvest blog posts</a> I‚Äôve written. If I wrote the post, I worked on that update.</em></li>

        <h2>Harvest Forecast <span>Lead Product Designer</span></h2>
        <p>In 2013, Harvest‚Äôs co-founders had an idea to build a sister service. While Harvest helps customers understand what their team is or was working on (the present and past), Forecast helps them visually plan and understand who will work on what and when (the future).</p>
        <p>I was the lead and sole designer for five years, and today over 68,000 people across 3400 teams are being scheduled in Forecast. Read these case studies for a detailed look at some of Forecast challenges:</p>
        <ul class="basecamp-case-study-links">
          <li><a href="#"><strong>The journey:</strong> Brought Forecast from back-of-napkin idea, to prototype, to closed beta, to public launch.</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Introduced the concept of scheduling <strong>placeholders</strong> when who to assign is unclear.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other major projects from this time include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added weekends and support for scheduling on other non-work days.</li>
          <li>Added new flexible filtering options for the schedule, so customers can more easily find what they need.</li>
          <li>Conceived and built all billing flows, such as upgrading to a paid plan, changing plans, discounts, and cancellation.</li>
          <li>Added Forecast assignments to Harvest project reports, so customers can track their estimates against their actuals.</li>
          <li><em>Note: You can also peruse old <a href="https://blog.getharvest.com/tag/forecast/" target="_blank">public Forecast blog posts</a>. Even if I didn‚Äôt write the post, chances are I worked on that update.</em></li>

        <h2>Harvest <span>Product Designer</span></h2>
        <p>I started at Harvest in October 2010. I think I got lucky because the co-founder and I connected over The Dismemberment Plan. My first assignments were major projects, and I quickly learned a lot collaborating with Shawn Liu.</p>
        <p>This was a critical time for my career, where I stopped designing for pure visual appeal and started considering user experience and the customers using our service. Major projects from this time include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed the new Timesheet, the core component of Harvest.</li>
          <li>Designed an all new Reporting suite. They were faster and more reliable at offering insights into your business.</li>
          <li>The first version of our Mac desktop companion app. Helps customers track time in their day without needing a browser.</li>
          <li>The first in-house version of our iPhone mobile companion app. Helps customers track time and expenses on the go.</li>
          <li>Multiple iterations of our marketing homepage (getharvest.com).</li>
          <li>Helping design the Chosen javascript library to make long select boxes more user-friendly.</li>

        <h2>Pre-Harvest <span>Designer</span></h2>
        <p>While it feels like a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I did have a few jobs before Harvest. My early career highlights include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Redesigned indie music startup AmieStreet, with a heavy emphasis on a unique payment model and new artists.</li>
          <li>Created multiple versions of a new Songza, which changed from internet radio, to community-based radio, to curated playlists.</li>
          <li>My first paid designer role was helping startup PeoplesMD create a community-powered database around treating and living with illnesses, diseases, and other ailments.</li>
          <li>Built and ran personal music blog The Heavy Edition for a few years. Garnered a few hundred followers at the time.</li>
          <li>Various freelance and contract gigs included building websites, brand identities, and even converting CSS to work with IE6.</li>
