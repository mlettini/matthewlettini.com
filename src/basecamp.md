üëã To Jason, David, and the team at Basecamp,

I‚Äôve been a Basecamp fan and user for many years. I nodded my head reading *It Doesn‚Äôt Have To Be Crazy At Work*, followed the 37Signals blog on and off, been inspired by your public company policies, and was an early sign up for HEY. So I was elated to see ‚Äúhiring a Senior Designer‚Äù land in my imbox.


But being a fan is not a qualification. Here is why I‚Äôd be a great candidate for the job‚Äî

**This October I hit 10 years as a designer at [Harvest](https://getharvest.com).** I was the first full-time design hire back in 2010. Now the most senior member of the product team, I‚Äôve grown and experienced a lot in the past decade.

At Harvest, I‚Äôve owned or been responsible for many things in various and changing capacities over the years, including both web products (Harvest and Forecast), our desktop and mobile apps, the marketing site, support documentation, data and success metrics, mentoring coworkers, and leading internal workshops. Under the tutelage of co-founders Shawn Liu and Danny Wen, and various colleagues over the years, the hats I wear have grown from purely designer to also product strategist, project manager, front-end developer, researcher, writer, data analyst, and more.

I excel as a generalist because what I love is solving design problems and challenges. My small way of impacting the world is to make software simpler and more clear for people. While I admit I‚Äôm not as well read as Ryan, *The Design of Everyday Things* and the principles of affordance are my North Star. And at its core: human-centered design and strong communication.

I can work on top-level product strategy, and low-level code implementation. I can take ideas from initial spark to finished product. And for the past couple of years now, I‚Äôve been doing this in cycles and the *Shape Up* methodology at Harvest. I‚Äôve both shaped and de-risked ideas into pitches, and scope-hammered work and successfully led a team to ship within 6 weeks. I‚Äôm an evangelist of the system.

As I consider my next career moves, I believe the skills and experience I‚Äôve gained in the past 10 years have set me up well for this opportunity at Basecamp, to both thrive and grow over my next decade and yours. The future of Basecamp and HEY sounds like an exciting time! I‚Äôd love to be a part of it. Heck, I‚Äôve already sent in a few feature requests over the years.

Since I‚Äôm not the type of employee to hop from job-to-job, I hope you‚Äôll excuse this hastily put together one-pager. Below is my attempt to resume-timeline and highlight some of the work I‚Äôm most proud of. I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions you may have.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,<br>
