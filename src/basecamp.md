To Jason, David, and the team at Basecamp,

I’ve been a Basecamp fan and user for many years. I nodded my head reading *It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work*, followed the 37Signals blog on and off, been inspired by your public company policies, and was an early sign up for HEY. So I was elated to see “hiring a Senior Designer” land in my imbox.

But being a fan is not a qualification. Here is why I’d be a great candidate for the job—

**This October I hit 10 years as a designer at [Harvest](https://getharvest.com).** I was the first full-time design hire back in 2010. Now the most senior member of the product team, I’ve grown and experienced a lot in the past decade.

At Harvest, I’ve owned or been responsible for many things in various and changing capacities over the years, including both web products (Harvest and Forecast), our desktop and mobile apps, the marketing site, support documentation, data and success metrics, mentoring coworkers, and leading internal workshops. Under the tutelage of co-founders Shawn Liu and Danny Wen and various colleagues over the years, the hats I wear have grown from purely designer to also product strategist, project manager, front-end developer, researcher, writer, data analyst, and more.

I excel as a generalist because I love solving design problems and challenges. My small way of impacting the world is to make software simpler and more clear for people. *The Design of Everyday Things* and the principles of affordance are my North Star. And at its core: human-centered design and strong communication.

I have worked on both top-level product strategy and low-level code implementation. I can take ideas from initial spark to finished product. And for the past couple of years now, I’ve been doing this in cycles and the *Shape Up* methodology at Harvest. I’ve both shaped and de-risked ideas into pitches, as well as scope-hammered work and successfully led teams to ship within 6 weeks.

After 10 years, I’m looking for new challenges, and the future of Basecamp and HEY offers a rare opportunity. These are tools that fundamentally help individuals and teams get things done, while retaining control and calm in their lives. They’re used for everything from personal needs, to planning small events, to building global businesses. And they’re built by an outspoken company that has inspired me for years.

**Helping design tools that help people change the world gets me excited to produce again.**

I believe my skills and experience have set me up well for this opportunity. There’d be no learning curve working in cycles or being a manager of one, I understand the intricacies of designing SaaS products made for teams, and I’m a user of both BC3 and HEY. Heck, I’ve even sent in a few feature requests over the years.

But I’m also excited for the chance to work alongside and learn from the best in the industry. The team behind Basecamp has been influential in shaping what it looks like to build software and treat users like humans. That’s where I’d like to grow over my next decade.

Since I’m not the type of employee to hop from job-to-job, I wasn’t ready to apply elsewhere when I learned you were hiring. So I hope you’ll excuse [my hastily put together resume-folio](https://matthewlettini.me/basecamp), just for this application. It’s my attempt at highlighting work I’m proud of at Harvest and how my role has changed over the years. While I didn’t have time to write detailed case studies for every project, I plan to add to it over the next week and I’m happy to answer any questions.

Finally, I’ll also mention that I bring my full, weird self to everything I do. Like everyone else, COVID-19 has up-ended most of my non-work life. So while I’d love to speak more about my love for basketball, traveling, karaoke, and D&amp;D, sadly those have all been on hold. But in their place is more camping in the catskills, moving during a pandemic, and trying to spend more time with my niece and nephew before they grow up too fast.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,<br>
Matthew Lettini
