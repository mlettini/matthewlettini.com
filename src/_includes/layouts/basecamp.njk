        <h2>Harvest <span>Senior Product Designer</span></h2>
        <p>In 2018, Harvest shuffled things around. The team underwent some large changes in the last few years: implementing cycles, hiring new directors, adding OKRs, and other process shifts. My role moved to senior, and alongside continuing to shape pitches and lead cycles, I also help mentor others on the product team.</p>
        <p>Projects from this time are small but numerous. Read these case studies for a detailed look at some of my work:</p>
        <ul class="basecamp-case-study-links">
          <li><a href="#">Improved our <strong>multi-step welcome flow</strong> to better onboard new trials, and remove friction in getting familiar with a new account.</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Audited and proposed a significant upgrade to Harvestâ€™s inconsistent <strong>information architecture (IA)</strong>.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other major projects from this time include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added all new email and desktop notification reminders, to help customers prompt themselves to track time.</li>
          <li>Improved cancellation flow with a new exit survey, to help us understand why customers churn, and remove friction from the cancellation experience.</li>
          <li>Added an easier way for yearly accounts to notice and remove unused paid seats, to help prevent the headache of issuing refunds.</li>
          <li>Small improvements to make recurring invoicing less manual.</li>
          <li><em>Note: You can also peruse old <a href="https://blog.getharvest.com/author/matt-lettini/" target="_blank">public Harvest blog posts</a> Iâ€™ve written. If I wrote the post, I worked on that update.</em></li>

        <h2>Harvest Forecast <span>Lead Product Designer</span></h2>
        <p>In 2013, Harvestâ€™s co-founders had an idea to build a sister service. While Harvest helps customers understand what their team is or was working on (the present and past), Forecast helps them visually plan and understand who will work on what and when (the future).</p>
        <p>I was the lead and sole designer for five years, and today over 68,000 people across 3400 teams are being scheduled in Forecast. Read these case studies for a detailed look at some of Forecast challenges:</p>
        <ul class="basecamp-case-study-links">
          <li><a href="#"><strong>The journey:</strong> Brought Forecast from back-of-napkin idea, to prototype, to closed beta, to public launch.</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Introduced the concept of scheduling <strong>placeholders</strong> when who to assign is unclear.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other major projects from this time include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added weekends and support for scheduling on other non-work days.</li>
          <li>Added new flexible filtering options for the schedule, so customers can more easily find what they need.</li>
          <li>Conceived and built all billing flows, such as upgrading to a paid plan, changing plans, discounts, and cancellation.</li>
          <li>Added Forecast assignments to Harvest project reports, so customers can track their estimates against their actuals.</li>
          <li><em>Note: You can also peruse old <a href="https://blog.getharvest.com/tag/forecast/" target="_blank">public Forecast blog posts</a>. Even if I didnâ€™t write the post, chances are I worked on that update.</em></li>

        <h2>Harvest <span>Product Designer</span></h2>
        <p>I started at Harvest in October 2010. I think I got lucky because the co-founder and I connected over The Dismemberment Plan. My first assignments were major projects, and I quickly learned a lot collaborating with Shawn Liu.</p>
        <p>This was a critical time for my career, where I stopped designing for pure visual appeal and started considering user experience and the customers using our service. Major projects from this time include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed the new Timesheet, the core component of Harvest.</li>
          <li>Designed an all new Reporting suite. They were faster and more reliable at offering insights into your business.</li>
          <li>The first version of our Mac desktop companion app. Helps customers track time in their day without needing a browser.</li>
          <li>The first in-house version of our iPhone mobile companion app. Helps customers track time and expenses on the go.</li>
          <li>Multiple iterations of our marketing homepage (getharvest.com).</li>
          <li>Helping design the Chosen javascript library to make long select boxes more user-friendly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pre-Harvest <span>Designer</span></h2>
        <p>While it feels like a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I did have a few jobs before Harvest. My early career highlights include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Redesigned indie music startup AmieStreet, with a heavy emphasis on a unique payment model and new artists.</li>
          <li>Created multiple versions of a new Songza, which changed from internet radio, to community-based radio, to curated playlists.</li>
          <li>My first paid designer role was helping startup PeoplesMD create a community-powered database around treating and living with illnesses, diseases, and other ailments.</li>
          <li>Built and ran personal music blog The Heavy Edition for a few years. Garnered a few hundred followers at the time.</li>
          <li>Various freelance and contract gigs included building websites, brand identities, and even converting CSS to work with IE6.</li>

    <p>Finally, Iâ€™ll mention that I bring my full, weird self to everything I do. Like everyone else, COVID-19 has up-ended most of my non-work life. So while Iâ€™d love to speak more about my love for basketball, traveling, karaoke, and D&amp;D, sadly those have all been on hold. But in their place is more camping in the catskills, moving during a pandemic, training my guitar fingers again, and trying to spend more time with my niece and nephew before they grow up too fast.</p>
