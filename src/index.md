Hey there! Iâ€™m a product designer, photography, and musician based in Brooklyn, NY.
Today, I work with a team of wonderful humans building great things at [Harvest](http://getharvest.com).

This website is heavily under-construction (insert gif) as I figure out Eleventy.
In the meantime, you can find me @mlettini in all the usual places:

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/mlettini), and
