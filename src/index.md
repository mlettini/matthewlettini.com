[ðŸ‘‹](mailto:mlettini@hey.com) Hey, Iâ€™m <strong>Matthew Lettini</strong>, a product designer working remotely from Brooklyn, NYC. My goal is to make life easier for people, one pixel at a time.

For the past decade, Iâ€™ve been doing this alongside a team of wonderful humans building great things at [Harvest](https://getharvest.com). Highlights of my work include new timesheet and report tools, leading the creation of [Forecast](https://getharvest.com/forecast), simplified onboarding and offboarding flows, designing our first Mac and iOS apps, and [Chosen](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen).

Beyond the desk I share a love of [photography](https://photos.matthewlettini.me), scary movies, karaoke, drums, guitar, dungeon crawling, the great outdoors, cognac, tiki drinks, and apparently comma-separated lists.

My social presence is lacking, but you can find me @mlettini in places like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mlettini), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mlettini), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/mlettini), and [Github](https://github.com/mlettini).
