ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Matthew, but everyone calls me Lettini.
Iâ€™m a product designer-who-codes from NYC.
My goal is to make life easier for people, one pixel at a time.
Along the way I try to make it a little more fun, too.

I recently spent over a âœ¨decadeâœ¨ helping to build
<a href="https://getharvest.com" target="_blank">Harvest</a> and
<a href="https://getharvest.com/forecast" target="_blank">Forecast</a>,
some of the webâ€™s best team time tracking, invoicing, and scheduling software.
Now Iâ€™m working on some exciting new stuff at
<a href="https://goodenough.us" target="_blank">Good Enough</a>, like
<a href="https://pika.page/" target="_blank">Pika</a> and
<a href="https://letsjelly.com/" target="_blank">Jelly</a>.

My strength is my ability to swiss army knife.
I do all the -ingâ€™s of a product generalist:
designing, managing, building, researching, strategizing,
analyzing, iterating, coding, team leadingâ€¦
you name it, I've -ing'd it.

Beyond the desk Iâ€™m a
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXeYImOFqui" target="_blank">new puppy</a>
dad-in-training, an out-of-practice musician,
and an avid gamer always ready to min-max a new D&D character.
I love hiking, basketball, karaoke, the oxford comma, and a good cognac.
