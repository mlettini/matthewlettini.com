[ðŸ‘‹](mailto:mlettini@hey.com) Hey there!

My name is **Matthew Lettini** and Iâ€™m a product designer working remotely from Brooklyn, NYC. My goal is to make life easier for people, one pixel at a time.

For the past decade, Iâ€™ve been helping build a world-class time tracking product with the team at [Harvest](https://getharvest.com). Iâ€™ve worked on just about everything, but highlights include redesigning the core timesheet and reporting suite, leading the creation of [Forecast](https://getharvest.com/forecast), designing our first Mac and iPhone apps, and [Chosen](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen).

Beyond the desk Iâ€™m usually [behind a camera](https://photos.matthewlettini.me), behind a drumset, on a basketball court, jamming at karaoke, or min-maxing a new D&D character.

My social presence is lacking but you can usually find me @mlettini in places like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mlettini), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mlettini), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/mlettini), [Github](https://github.com/mlettini), and elsewhere. You can [say hey here](mailto:mlettini@hey.com).
