description: Brooklyn-based product designer building great things at Harvest.

Matthew Lettini is a product designer working remotely from Brooklyn, NY, with a love of [photography](https://photos.matthewlettini.me), scary movies, karaoke, drumming, dungeon crawling, mid-century furniture, tiki drinks, cognac, and apparently run-on sentences.

For the past decade, he’s worked alongside a team of wonderful humans building great things at [Harvest](https://getharvest.com). In that time, he’s been responsible for projects like the new timesheet and report tools, the creation of [Forecast](https://getharvest.com/forecast), simplified onboarding and cancellation flows, notification reminders, and so much more.

His social presence is lacking, but you can find @mlettini in the usual places: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mlettini), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mlettini), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/mlettini), [Github](https://github.com/mlettini), and [Hey](mailto:mlettini@hey.com).
