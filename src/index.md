ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew. Iâ€™m a software designer and developer thatâ€™s been building, improving, and shipping digital product experiences for over 15 years. My goal is to make life easier for people, one pixel at a time.

Iâ€™ve been doing this at [Harvest](https://getharvest.com) for the last decade, helping to build a world-class time tracking product alongside a world-class team. Previously I was designing new ways to purchase and listen to music online at [Amie Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amie_Street).

I excel as a product generalist, blurring the line between product designer and product manager. My experiences have led me to wear many hats, including project manager, team lead, strategist, researcher, data analyst, and a million things in between. Iâ€™m also a designer who codes and spend a lot of my time designing in and writing HTML & CSS.

Beyond the desk Iâ€™m a [new puppy](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXeYImOFqui) dad-in-training, an out-of-practice musician, and an avid gamer always ready to min-max a new D&D character. I love hiking, basketball, karaoke, the oxford comma, and a good cognac.

Iâ€™m currently working remotely from Brooklyn, NYC. You can say hello by emailing [mlettini@gmail.com](mailto:mlettini@gmail.com?subject=Hello!) or finding me @mlettini in most places.
