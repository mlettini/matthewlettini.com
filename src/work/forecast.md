Time tracking with Harvest helps teams understand their present and their past, but what about their future? How do they plan their time? Back in 2013, Harvest set out to help our customers with this problem. The result was [Forecast](https://getharvest.com/forecast), a companion app with the ability to plot your team’s upcoming assignments along a horizontal timeline.

Between 2013 and 2018, Forecast was created and maintained by a small team that consisted of just the CEO, myself, and a rotating set of 4 engineers. I was the product lead, responsible for all things product: strategy, research, design, project management, UI & UX, HTML & CSS, and even customer support at times. For those few years, Forecast was my baby.

Through extensive research, we learned that many customers typically plan their teams with clunky spreadsheets. These sheets lack the ability to quickly pivot when plans change and are frequently out-of-date. It’s a heavy-handed approach we wanted to modernize.

The design of Forecast is heavily influenced by applications like Garageband, offering a visual and fluid experience for managing a team’s time. It supports options like click-and-drag, splitting, moving, timeline shifting, zooming, real-time updating, and more. These features combine to bring real flexibility to the scheduling process.

As the designer and product lead, it was my job to make the experience of using Forecast easy, learnable, and delightful. Here’s a rough but extensive demo I created for our beta customers prior to the official launch, which demonstrates many of the core concepts that still define the app today:

As you can see, Forecast offers customers an important birds-eye-view of their upcoming work and helps them plan around who’s doing what and when. It was a big hit with our Harvest customers.

Our team continued to improve Forecast for many years beyond the 2014 launch. We iterated on behind-the-scenes flows like billing and onboarding, helped unlock insights with reports and exports, and added many features that enhanced the experience. For example, here’s a couple demos of some later features, narrated by my wonderful coworkers:

I worked on Forecast for five years, until an organization shift in 2018. It was a fantastic experience to not only build and ship a product from scratch, but iterate on it for many years based on customer feedback and our future plans. I have many reflections from my time with Forecast that I’d be happy to talk your ear off about.

Today, Forecast helps manage over 82,000 purchased seats and brings in over $4,000,000 dollars in annual revenue for Harvest. You can learn more and even try it out at [https://getharvest.com/forecast](https://www.getharvest.com/forecast) (I also designed the marketing site).
