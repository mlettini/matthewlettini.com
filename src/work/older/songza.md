While working at [Amie Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amie_Street) in 2009, the company also purchased [Songza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songza). We used the brand and itâ€™s technology to create a number of nich and cool internet radio products, all centered around music stations and playlists. I was the chief designer and also responsible for the front-end HTML and CSS development.
