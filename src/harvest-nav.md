  <h1 class="mb-16">Hello world!</h1>
  <p class="mb-16">
    This is a testing ground with various design explorations for Harvestapp and Porchlight. Please approach it with caution and a grain-of-salt. Here be dragons. Some of the ideas Iâ€™m exploring include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Left-side navigation</strong><br>
      Offers more space to include iconography, group related sections, and make Harvest full-width.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Headlines</strong><br>
      Attempting to be consistent in naming and defining every page in the app. This can help with spatial awareness and IA.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Consistent content</strong><br>
      Trying to make things like timeframe selectors, filters, export buttons, summaries, and more consistently designed and in the same location regardless of section.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Flatter design</strong><br>
      Pulling from the new brand, removing gradients and shadows, and making Harvest feel more modern.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>New UX</strong><br>
      Testing things like a new filter design, pagination design, and add-buttons on the right.
    </li>
  </ul>
