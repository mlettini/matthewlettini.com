  <h1 class="mb-16">Hello world!</h1>
  <p class="mb-16">
    This is a testing ground with various design explorations for Harvestapp and Porchlight. Please approach it with caution and many grains-of-salt. Here be dragons. Some of the ideas I’m exploring include:
  </p>
  <ul class="ml-16">
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Left-side navigation</strong><br>
      Offers more space to include iconography, group related sections, feel more modern, and match a full-width responsive Harvest.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Consistent headlines</strong><br>
      Attempting to directly name and define every page in the app. This is an IA iteration that can help customers with spatial awareness and understanding where they are.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Consistent components</strong><br>
      Attempting to make things like timeframe selectors, filters, export buttons, summaries, and more consistently designed and in the same location on every page in the app.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Accessible rebrand</strong><br>
      Pulling design from the new brand, but altered to work better with a modern web app and be more accessible.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>No “Manage” section</strong><br>
      This is an IA iteration based out of recent research. Managing is confusing in Harvest today, so here I experiment with these pages living under different sections.
    </li>
  </ul>
